# How To Use                           
  
- Drag the script onto any object that contains the camera or the camera itself.(or other objects if you want)
- Adjust the ***min*** to something like ( *X : 358, Y : 356, Z : 355* ) and the ***max*** to something like ( *X : 2, Y : 4, Z : 5* ) (**you can't use negative numbers they get converted to positive and proper angles automatically**)
- Adjust the ***Speed*** (**the speed of the camera moving to the new location**)                    
- Adjust the ***Update Delay*** (**the delay of creating a new random angle for the camera**)
- Enter ***Play Mode***
